% you've gone through this tutorial you will probably want to learn more.
% Check out the "Other Resources" listed at the end of this handout.

% *Launching MATLAB*

% When you start MATLAB, the command prompt ">>" appears. You will tell

% MATLAB GUI (Graphical User Interface) now and become familiar with the
% features.

%% This is the start of a something called a 'Section' in MATLAB.

% If you didn't notice already, some text in this script is green. This
% indicates that the text is a 'comment'. Comments are ignored by MATLAB
% when we actually run a script. Any line that begins with the '%' symbol
% is a comment.

% Anything that starts with '%%' is a section (assuming 'Sections' are
% enabled in the MATLAB preferences).

% Sections allow you to step through your code and run only sections of it.

% Question: What is the significance of the ";" at the end of the line?

%% Syntax
%
% * White space does not matter. For example
a=1+1
%%
% is the same as 
a  =  1 +      1
%%
% * ';' are important though
x = 1 y = 2
%%
x = 1; y = 2
%%
% To suppress the output you can type
clear a
a = 1 + 1;
%%
% Now look at the "workspace". Variable _a_ is there, but because we used
% the ";" operator at the end, the output to the "command window" was
% suppressed.

%% Variable explorer
% Let's look at _a_ now. At the "command window" type _a_.
a
%%
% You see that the value is returned. Now type _whos a_
whos a
%%
% We can now look at the variable _a_ to learn about it properties. You can
% also *double-click _a_* in the workspace tab to pull up the "Variable
% Explorer" that gives you the ability to look at _a_ in the form of a
% table.

%% Data types in MATLAB
%
% * Numeric Types: Integer and floating-point data
% * Characters and Strings: Text in character arrays
% * Dates and Time: Arrays of date and time values that can be displayed in different formats
% * Categorical Arrays: Arrays of qualitative data with values from a finite set of discrete, nonnumeric data
% * Tables: Arrays in tabular form whose named columns can have different types
% * Structures: Arrays with named fields that can contain data of varying types and sizes
% * Cell Arrays: Arrays that can contain data of varying types and sizes
% * Function Handles: Variables that allow you to invoke a function indirectly
% * Map Containers: Objects with keys that index to values, where keys need not be integers
% * Time Series: Data vectors sampled over time
%
% You can find more info about all of these at 
% http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/data-types_data-types.html

%%
% To find out what something is you can type "help isa"
help isa
%%
% Keep in mind that all of these "types" take of different amounts of
% memory. You can allocate a variable as a certain data type or you can
% convert a variable from one data type to another after you have declared
% that variable. For example type "b = single(a); whos"

%% Saving your workspace.
% MATLAB offers the user the ability to save all current variables (or just
% a subset) to disk in MATLAB's native ".mat" format. This is a binary file
% format and can be loaded back into MATLAB with a single command. Below we
% go through an example.
